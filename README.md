## Martian Robot Tracker
###### Tracking all the robots on Mars! 

As a first pass for [the challenge](https://gist.github.com/winnab/61302fec56ace204064e), I'm using a javascript [jasmine-node](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node)-based test-driven solution that runs in your terminal.

## Install
```
npm install
```

## Run
```
jasmine-node spec/ --verbose
```
